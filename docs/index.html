        <p>Welcome to my personal website, a place where you can get to know me and all my interests</p>

            <h2>Short introduction to myself</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Jasper! I'm 17 and totally into everything tech and music. I've been drumming since I was 6, and it's still one of my biggest passions. I'm also a bit of a hobby collector — I dive into something new almost every month, but always carry a piece of each one with me. This site is my little corner of the internet to share what I'm into and what I'm creating. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

        <h2>Drums Forever</h2>

            <section>
                <p>I started drumming back in my first year of primary school, thanks to Régine Mosuse — a mom who gave weekend drumming lessons in the attic of our school. That’s where it all began. When those lessons ended, I continued at De Nieuwe Muziekschool in Mortsel, Belgium. I spent several years there, learning, playing, and eventually joining a band at the school.</p>
                <p>After a while, my teacher told me I could still come to learn songs, but not really anything new — so I decided it was time to move on. I kept playing in the music school’s band for another year before taking a break from organized music.</p>
                <p>Now, I play in a small band with two friends. We’re just getting started and still figuring things out, but we’re hoping to play our first little performance next year. Drumming’s always been part of my life — and I’m sure it always will be.</p>

                <h2>Graphics, Drawing, Pictures</h2>
                <p>Creativity has always been a big part of who I am. For as long as I can remember, I loved drawing — I’d fill sketchbooks and scrap paper with all kinds of ideas, and I kept drawing regularly until I was about 14. Around that time, my interest in technology started growing, and that slowly pulled me in a new direction.</p>
                <p>That’s when I discovered photography. At first, it was just snapping random pictures here and there, but over time I got more serious about it. I now use a Canon Powershot G5 — it's an older camera with "only" 5 megapixels, but it shoots in RAW, and I love using it. It’s compact, reliable, and lets me focus on the artistic side of photography rather than worrying about having the most high-end gear.</p>
                <p>When I was in my first year of secondary school (around age 12 or 13), I took Photoshop and Illustrator classes at the Academie in Berchem, Belgium. It was my first proper dive into digital design, and while I found some parts of it interesting, the classes didn’t really fit into my weekly routine, and over time I realized that structured graphic design classes weren’t quite my thing.</p>
                <p>The year after that, I gave animation a try. I took a class that included both 2D hand-drawn animation and 3D stop-motion using photography. That really clicked with me creatively — I loved building scenes and bringing things to life frame by frame. But again, the class just didn’t feel right because I didn’t really connect with the teacher’s style or approach, which made it hard to stay motivated.</p>
                <p>Even though I didn’t stick with those classes, they definitely left their mark. I still enjoy making digital artwork from time to time, especially using Inkscape — it's a great (and free!) alternative to Adobe’s tools, which are a bit out of budget for a student like me. And photography has become a bigger part of my life than ever before. I try to capture interesting angles, moods, and moments wherever I go (If I don't forget my camera, which unfortunately happens quite often) — it’s become one of my favorite creative outlets.</p>

                <h2>Technology keeps advancing, So do I</h2>
                <p>Technology is a huge part of my life — it’s one of those things I never really get tired of exploring. I especially love buying second-hand gear, mainly laptops. I’m always on the lookout for hidden gems: devices that just need a little love to get back in shape. Sometimes I fix them, sometimes I just enjoy using them for a while, and more often than not, I end up selling them (usually for a profit!) to fund the next project.</p>
                <p>When I got my first student job, I used my first paycheck to buy a mini PC. That same machine is now running as my personal home lab server — and yes, it’s also hosting this website! It’s a fun project where I’ve set up a bunch of well-known tools and containers like Nextcloud, Portainer, Nginx Proxy Manager, and Cockpit (which isn’t containerized but is a great enterprise system management tool). On top of that, I’m also running a few small apps of my own just to test, experiment, and learn more.</p>
                <p>My journey really began with an old laptop that a friend gave me. It worked fine with Windows for a bit, but eventually it started to lag behind. That’s when I discovered Linux — and I instantly fell in love. I started customizing everything (a.k.a. ricing — you can see it on the picture on the side), and even though I don’t rice as much these days, I’m still a proud daily Linux user.</p>
                <!-- Picture of Linux Rice, already in assets -->
                <p>This passion has led me toward coding and software as well. I’ve already started working through <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp’s</a> Full Stack Developer course, and in two years, after I finish secondary school, I’m planning to study Applied Computer Science at college. My dream is to become a full stack developer — but really, I just want to keep building cool stuff, learning new things, and diving deeper into the tech world I love.</p>
